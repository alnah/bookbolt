**Features**

BookBolt prioritizes the use of **object constructors and prototypes** over the ES6 class syntax. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of JavaScript's object-oriented programming capabilities.

It Implements the **Model-View-Controller** pattern for structured code management and separation of concerns.

  - **Model**: Manages the data and logic of the application.


  - **View**: Handles the display and presentation to the user.


  - **Controller**: Intermediates between the model and view, processing user input.

BookBolt is designed to be **fully responsive**, ensuring that the application is accessible and usable across a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
